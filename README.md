# Ringtail UI Extension SDK
This SDK provides a nice API to communicate with Ringtail's UI, implemented around [postMessage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) for secure cross-origin communications. It manages serializing context and change events through JSON and coordinating message responses so that User Interface Extensions (UIX) don't have to worry about the details.

## Getting Started
